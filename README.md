# MitigationController

The mitigation controller that can be found in this space, is the basis for a Masters Thesis by Rik van Dijk at Delft University of Technology. This study focusses on optimising a mitigation strategy within construction projects. This tool looks at the ways in which variability in project cost can be mitigated in an as effective as possible manner.
